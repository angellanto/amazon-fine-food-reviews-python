### Social Media Analytics for Business Intelligence | Team Assignment Grade: 90/100
### Professor Comment:
Great job. The code is functional and generally well structured, though some outputs appear without enough context and a few sections repeat unnecessarily, which affects readability. The analytical methods are appropriate, and the slides include relevant recommendations. However, the presentation takes too long to communicate the core value of your work. The assignment asked for a concise summary, and in a business context, being able to translate complex analysis into clear, focused insights is essential. Sharpening how you communicate the impact of your findings will make your work even more effective.
